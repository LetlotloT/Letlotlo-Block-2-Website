         <h1>My First Semester Coding</h1>
         <p>
            <p>As a music student, taking a course that does not correspond with any of my other courses was a risk. Taking a course that I had no background knowledge on was an attempt to fail. It was my interest in understanding the power of the internet in our everyday lives and in how it affects our musicking that keeps me interested. I must say that I am enjoying the theory content more than the coding itself. However, I now understand that it all starts with the code. Most of my interaction with music start with a code, whether it is streaming or composing on a software, there is code. I am beginning to understand the power of this craft. I had decided from the moment I registered for this course that I will take it one day at a time and always remind myself not to compare myself people who have been coding for years. Therefore, for my first website, I have decided keep it simple, use code that I have learned during lectures and try not to do anything I have not yet learned in class. Here I will be giving a critical reflection of my website and the work we have done throughout the semester.</p>
            <p>Theory</p>
            <p>The theoretical component has been the one that I have enjoyed the most. Learning about the Web at critical levels that we have has allowed me the opportunity to see the impact of the Web in everyday life. My week 2 critical writing post is one that I wrote with no idea of what was required of me. I therefore put my own thoughts and opinions into the paper, rather than critically engage the Turing’s reading. However, I soon got the pattern of the level of engagement required to engage these readings.  For weeks 4 and 6, I chose topics that would help broaden my understanding of the discourse of web development. In the first few weeks of the course it was quite a grapple, to an extent still is, with understanding the discourse and language used. Therefore, I was beneficial for me to choose topics that would help me broaden my understanding. Nonetheless, I intentionally wrote short reflections as an attempt to not overwhelm myself. Week 9’s critical reflection was one that required most of my engagement. Understanding Graham et al’s survey and the many questions it came with also made me realise how the internet is a reflection of the world and the relations of power we live in. Due to procrastination and mismanagement of time, I did not write the last two posts.</p>
            <p>Creative</p>
            <p>I have been postponing doing my style guides and my wireframes. Therefore, this component of the website was not engaged. However, my choices of colour and structure are those that I wanted to reflect me. The main colour theme of the web was taken from the background picture then used throughout the website. My overall idea was simplicity and calmness.</p>
            <p>Technical</p>
            <p>This component of the website was one that gave me the most ups and downs. The many ways in which on thing can be done made more tough to grasp. HTML is fairly straight forward. It is CSS and Javascript that I struggled with the most. CSS began frustrating me when the website changed when opened on different browers. Work that we did on Flex and Grids helped me understand how to make a structured and neat website that is reponsive. However, I only watched the lectures quite late, using Grids and Flex would have caused a lot of changes I would have not been able to fix in time. My website has very little Javascript, I am not even sure if it is enough and whether I used it appropriately to show my understanding of the language. That is because I still do not understand how it works, and what its purpose is for. I managed to have a few onmouse functions. However, that is all I could do with it.</p>
            <p>Conclusion</p>
            <p>My website is not at the level which I would have loved, but this is all on me. In the second block I did not manage my time well. This resulted in me running out of time and having to make short cuts. However, this is a lesson learned for the exam and the 2nd semester.</p>
