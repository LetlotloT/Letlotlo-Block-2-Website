    <h2>Computing Machinery and Intelligence by Allan Turing</h2>
    
        
  <p>Allan Turing is widely considered as the father of modern computer science and the father of artificial intelligence. Turing helped crack the German’s coding machine, Enigma, during WW2. In this paper Turing begins with the question “Can machines think?”. To make it simple to answer this question in an understandable way Turing uses the Imitation Game, also known as the “Turing test”. Here Turing puts a computer machine in a practical scenario where we can find out whether the machine really can think.</p>   
        
       
  <p>In the Imitation Game player 1, player 2 and an interrogator participate. By communication from other room with player 1 and player 2, the interrogator needs to find out who between the two players is the man and who the woman. Both players’ objectives are to convince the interrogator that they are the woman. Therefore, the man tries to deceive the interrogator that he is the woman while the woman tries to convince the interrogator that she is the woman. Turing goes on to propose that if the man between the two players is substituted with a computer machine and the machine is successful at the convincing the interrogator that it is the woman, then the machine can therefore think. </p>   
       
  
  <p> Turing then discuses some points that oppose his question “Can machines think?”. One of the arguments he raises is the ‘Heads in the Sand’ objection. Here the argument is that the consequences of a machine thinking would be too dreadful and therefore based on that, machines cannot think. Another argument he raises is ‘The Theological Question’ objection that says that thinking is an attribute given to men and women by God, therefore, no animal nor machine can think. Turing says the latter is motivated by the same feeling as the former. As humans we want to believe that we are the superior to any other living thing in the world. We then fear the thought of something better than us living in this world.</p> 
        
  
  <p> I want to believe that the question Turing had in his mind was not the one he asked but rather “Are machines capable of thinking like humans?”. The Imitation Game focuses on one factor, deception. There are so many ways humans express the action of thinking. We read, we do sums, we plan, we see patterns and take advantage of them, etc. Why does Turning choose to find out whether a machine is capable of deception, not just deception but deceiving a human being? Because he is scared. You are scared and I am scared. We want to take advantage of them and utilise them for your own personal gains but cannot fathom the thought of machines outthinking us.</p>    
        
  
  <p>Turing’s other opposing arguments to the original question clearly try to dehumanize machines. For me, these arguments proof more that machines are not humans than oppose whether machines can think. His consciousness argument, arguments from various disabilities, Lady Lovelace's argument, arguments from continuity in the nervous system, argument from informality of behaviour, arguments from extrasensory perception all focus on how a machine is not a human and therefore cannot think. </p> 
        
  
  <p>But what if a machine can think? What if it can do better than that? What if it does not “think” but rather “skniht”? What if “gnikniht” is better than “thinking”? Maybe machines are saints and we are the devils. Afterall, we create them and we use them. </p>

    <h3>Understanding URL</h3>
    <p> 
      

 

<p>What is it?</p>

<p>URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It is the mechanism used by browsers to withdraw published resources on the Web. Like a street address, each URL points to a specific resource and is made up of components that provide different information. URLs are managed by the owner of the web server to make sure that a URL directs to its specific resource. URLs may sometimes not point to a resource. This exception is when the resource no longer exists or has been moved.</p>

 

<p>The anatomy of a URL</p>

<p>URLs are made up of different parts: the scheme, domain name, port, file path, parameters, and anchor. Let’s use the URL https://www.example.com:80/path/to/mylife.html?key1=value1 (Links to an external site.)&key2=value2#SomewhereInTheDocument</p>     



<p>Scheme </p>

<p>The scheme tells which protocol (a fixed method for transferring data around a computer network) the browser uses to request the resource. Protocols are usually Https or http but not limited to these. When putting the URL in the address bar you do not need to add the scheme as the browser may already know which protocol to use.</p>

<p>Authority</p>

<p>The authority includes both, if present, the domain and the port.  The authority and scheme have the character pattern :// dividing them while the domain is separated from the port by a :</p>

<p>Domain</p>

<p>This is the main part of the URL and indicates which web server is being requested and also tells you the company that runs the site. The domain name (www.example.com (Links to an external site.)) has a subdomain (www. or accounts.) and a top-level domain (.com .edu .co.za)</p>
<p>Port</p>

 <p>The port, if present, indicates the technical gate used to access the resources on the web server.</p>
<p>Path File</p>

<p>File path (/path/to/mylife.html) directs the browser to a specific page on the web server.</p>

<p>
    Parameters
</p>

<p>Parameters (?key1=value1 (Links to an external site.)&key2=value2) provide the server with information to load the correct web page.</p>

<p>Anchor</p>


<p>An anchor directs the browser to a specific part of the resource. It becomes a sort of ”bookmark” inside the page. It may help the browser go to an image or video in the resource.
</p>
 

<p>How to use URLs</p>

<p>URLs are typed inside the address bar to get to the specific page or resource behind it. URLs can be substituted by IP addresses. Instead on typing a URL you can use an IP address to you direct the browser to a resource. The advantage of using URLs is they represent a human readable entry point. They can be memorised. Also, when semantic URLs (the use of words with inherent meaning that can be used by anyone) are used it is easy to understand and manipulate URLs. The sue of semantic URLs also clarifies things for users in terms of where they are, what they are doing, what they are reading or interacting with on the resource.</p>

    <h4> Metadata. What, why, how</h4>
    
    <p>
       

 


        <p>Metadata is basically data about data. It is pieces of information that have meaning in relation to other pieces of information. This data can be created, managed, stored and preserved like any other piece of data. Metadata falls into 3 categories: descriptive, which is used to describe, discover and identify and includes information such as title, author, abstract, keywords; structural, which shows how information is put together; and administrative, which enables better resource management by showing information such as when and how the resource created.</p>

        <p> Metadata enables and improves the use of that resource/data. It helps find that resource and other related resources. Data in formats like video. audio and images are searched using text. Without this text (metadata) these resources would be hard to find.  Metadata also helps to understand data and how to use it.
        </p>

       <p> Another use of metadata is as a means if facilitating interoperability and integrating resources. Using metadata to describe resources helps humans and machines understand these resources and exchange them throughout many data systems.</p>

        <p>Metadata also helps protect resources for future accessibility. Metadata elements help for archiving and preserving data, and also for future purposes when archiving technologies change.</p>

        <P>Metadata is essential for maintain historical records of ong-term data sets, it facilitates reuse and sharing, and helps extend longevity.</P>

        <h5> A close reading of ‘Towards a study of informaion geographies: (im)mutable augmentations and a mapping of the geographies of information’ by Mark Graham et al. (2015)</h5>
        
        <p>
           
    
     
    
    
            <p>The purpose of this close reading is to give a summary of ‘Towards a study of information geographies: (im)mutable augmentations and a mapping of the geographies of information’, and critically reflect on the paper.</p>
    
            <p>Introduction of Paper</p>
            <p>The paper begins with the statement “Information has always had geography. It is from somewhere; about somewhere; it evolves and is transformed somewhere; it is mediated by networks, infrastructures, and technologies: all of which exist in physical, material places”. This statement holds the key ideas of the purpose of the paper. </p>
            <p>Methodology</p>
            <p>Mark Graham, Stefano De Sabbata and Matthew Zook offer a survey of a range of key platforms that mediate, host and deliver different types of geographic information. The survey is discussed more below.</p>
            <p>Aim</p>
            <p>They offer this survey to show that information geographies (specifically relating to access, participation and representation) too have geographic distributions.</p>
            <p>Results and Conclusion</p>
            <p>The survey gives evidence to the uneven access to, and uneven participation and representation in contemporary modes of communication. Due to these unevennesses, information (here geographic information) is characterized by uneven geographies.  It is important to highlight uneven geographies of geographic information because of how strongly geographic information shapes the physical places they give information about. We see in the paper how one part of the world has more geographic information available than another due to the unevenness of access, participation and representation in contemporary modes of communication. Further, control and power relation become part of the understanding of these unevennesses. The paper then highlights the creation of immutable mobiles (pre-digital age technology) and the transfer to (im)mutable augmentations (post-information scarcity technology).</p>
            <p>From immutable to (im)mutable</p>
            <p>Graham et al say that due to how information changes and adapts to a context, to avoid mutability, immutable mobiles such as the printing press were created. Immutable mobiles allow for the transportation of information without significant change to its meaning. and also, they are able to store in them geographies, Therefore, immutable mobiles can impact the representation of a place, not only in the place they reference, but in other parts of the world too. However, with ICTs’ creation of (im)mutable augmentations, ICTs facilitated for the evolution of information. (Im)mutable augmentations allow, not only for information to impact geographies, but for information be a part of those geographies. They are ‘(im)mutable’ because this information may be either mutable or immutable. Graham et al use The Sydney Opera House to explain this how information becomes a part of the place. They say that The Sydney Opera House is not only brick and mortar, or only represented by a guidebook and other immutable mobiles. There are videos, images, reviews about past performances, and stories about experiences, this information is part of the bringing of the place is to being, and can remain fixed or changed as new experiences as formed at the opera house.  Therefore, places invisible or discounted in immutable mobiles and (im)mutable augmentations are equally invisible in practice to many people. However, Zook and Graham say that “fusing of the spatial and informational augmentations that are immutable can result in high stakes as annotations of place emerge as sites of political contestation: with different groups of people trying to impose different narratives on informational augmentations” (2007). The ‘geography of information’ has been a key means of control and power formation. The paper then gives a background on pre-digital geographies of information.</p>
            <p>Pre-digital geographies of information</p>
            <p>Graham et al state that during the pre-digital age, tools and skills required to engage with information were scarce and geographically embedded.  Also, this information was fixed in specific locations like universities. This meant that there were access barriers that kept information in one place. Moreover, even if pre-digital technologies like books could be moved from one place to another, information embedded in these technologies were still constrained in them. And all this goes back to power. Constrains manifested themselves into hegemonic representations and hegemonic modes of participation. Hegemonic representations have been about exerting political, economic and social power.</p>
            <p>Then came the revolution. Well, for a few. </p>
            <p>In recent decades, the world has seen a upward change in the availability of information, implying that the world has moved to an age of post-information scarcity. This move is highlighted by the increasing accessibility to computers, as well as a host of associated social, economic, and political practices, allowing for the receiving and transmitting of information. Accessibility has allowed citizens to play a role in shaping information. But how do the geographies of this accessibility, participation and representation look? The survey investigates this. Let’s now go into the methodology and results.</p>
            <p>The Investigation and the results</p>
            <p>A survey of a range of key platforms that mediate, host and deliver different types of geographic information is offered to investigate three categories: geographies of access and enablement, geographies of participation, and geographies of representation. Graham et al focus the survey to the scale of countries, using a combination of existing statistics and bespoke data not previously mapped or analysed.</p>
            <p>Geographies of access and enablement</p>
            <p>Here data was used to find the number of internet users and the internet penetration percentage of each country. The results found was that Asia had the largest number of internet users at 42% of the world’s internet users. However, this does not mean that the penetration of the internet in Asia was high. For example, China contributed the largest number of internet users but this number was only 20-40% of the its population. There was still 60%+ of the population that was not using the internet.</p>
            <p>This data also shows in which regions of the world the internet had high penetration. Data shows Europe with high levels of penetration compared to other regions. Even though regions like North Africa had doubled their internet users in recent years to the survey, they still had low penetration percentages.</p>
            <p>Another aspect that influences access is the cost. Here the cost of internet access in a country is examined with the average income of the country. The data shows how countries with high levels of internet penetration were those with low relative costs of connection. In countries where average income was low, less penetration was found. For example Eritrea’s yearly subscription costed an equivalent of almost 50 years of an average salary, while the North America’s monthly cost of internet connection was only a few hours’ work.</p>
            <p>Geographies of participation</p>
            <p>To understand the geographies of participation, Graham et al explore three different variables: domain names (as an indication of content produced on the open Web), Github users (as a measure of contributions to the world’s largest open software repository), and Wikipedia edits (as a measure of contributions to the world’s largest open encyclopaedia). Examining these platforms highlights that difference in platform and purpose shape users’ involvement.</p>
            <p>Domain Names</p>
            <p>The two domains name types used are generic Top-Level Domains (gTLDs) such as .com or .org, and country code Top-Level Domains (ccTLDs) associated with specific countries. Domain names are used as indicators for levels of online content production per country. This assumes that ccTLDs are created and used by the people of the country they belong, for expample za domains are created and used in South Africa. The results to take away from the data is that countries with large numbers of internet users do not translate into large number of domain registrations. A country with a number of users may contribute less that one with low internet users.</p>
            <p>GitHub</p>
            <p>Git Hub allows to see who participate in code contribution. Data shows how the United Staes was home to 31% of GitHub users but contributed 35% of commits made on GitHub, while India accounting for 3.6% of users with only 1.7% of the commits. This data shows how North America and Europe are the largest users and contributors to commits. These regions are more involved in collaborative code development.</p>
            <p>Wikipedia</p>
            <p>Wikipedia, an open platform that allows all internet users to contribute, offers an indicator of a more generalized level of content creation and contribution. Data shows how pver a million edits each quarter came from users located in the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom and France, while contributions from Africa are so low that there were more edits that originated in Hong Kong than the whole continent combined.</p>
            <p>This section shows the distribution of three modes of participation in contemporary digitally mediated societies. The general ideas of the data remains consistent: the global North was characterised by the greatest levels of participation and is creating the bulk of digital content, while the global South contributes very little. Africa, in particular, was almost entirely omitted from these processes of participation and creation.</p>
            <p>Geographies of representation</p>
            <p>To understand the geographies of representation within the (im)mutable augmentations of the world Graham et al analyze the geographies of the following digital representations: Google Search (the world’s most used search engine), OpenStreetMap (the world’s largest open map), and the Semantic Web as defined by Freebase (one of the largest collaborative ‘knowledge bases’ 10) and Geonames (the world’s largest open gazetteer). Data on these systems show spatial differences in digital representation.</p>
            <p>Google Searches</p>
            <p>Geographic content that Google contains or omits can have a significant impact on the representation of places. After searching mentions of countries’ names, it was found that google finds quite a high number of web pages mentioning that each county’s name, for both highly populated and sparsely populated territories. It was found that Google’s indexing is not characterized by the massive geographic inequalities seen in access, participation. However, the data indicates that Google is simply reflecting the broader uneven information inequalities that make up the web. Highly populated regions got more mentions than lower populated regions.</p>
            <p>OpenStreetMap</p>
            <p>OpenStreetMap (OSM) is the world’s largest roadmap, therefore it is important to understand how much content OSM contains about different parts of the world. Data shows that OSM follows the same patterns of access and participation. OSM has more geographic information about the United States, France, Canada, Germany and Russia (58% of content on OSM) than about places like Latin America and Africa (only 5%).</p>
            <p>Semantic Web as defined by Freebase and Geonames</p>
            <p>Semantic web is a movement to make the web more efficient by creating common frameworks that allow data to be easily shared and reused across sites, services and places. The two of the most important back-end databases for the semantic web are Freebase and GeoNames. Here data found was that Freebase geographic entities were overwhelmingly concentrated in North America and Europe with United States having the largest concentration (45% of place names with only 5% of the world’s population and 10% of internet users). Most of Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean underrepresented. Nigeria contained less than 0.1% of place names in the dataset, despite being home to 2.5% of the world’s population. In Geonames with was found that more content about the United States than all of Asia or Europe.  Because Freebase and GeoNames are essential components of many contemporary semantic web services, the presences and absences outlined here have the potential to have a significant impact on how geographic information and geographies are understood, interacted with, and used.</p>
            <p>This data on found these three platforms was evidence that some parts of the world were over-represented (North America and Europe) and the rest of the world were under-represented.</p>
            <p>Conclusion of Paper</p>
            <p>The conclusion of the paper is that in addition to uneven geographies of access to contemporary modes of communication, uneven geographies of participation and representation was also evidence that these unevennesses were being amplified rather than alleviated. This paper helps us understand how information impacts geographies. (Im)mutable augmentations like Wikipedia are systems where citizens can be involved in the making and changing of content (geographic content too). These (im)mutable augmentations also affect how we see the world. Therefore, Thus, it is important to know who gets to give this information and who does not, who and what the information is and is not about, etc. Lastly, Graham et al also highlight that this paper is not an end to but a beginning to studies like these. More focused and related studies to this one need to be made.</p>
            <p>My General Reflection of the paper</p>
            <p>When I finished reading this paper I realised that the findings in this paper are very much interlinked with a number of other topics. One topic that the article references is power, that information has always been subject to power. It also highlights culture, for example how people in a certain region may be disinterested in contributing to Wikipedia edits. I think it is important to talk about these in more depth.</p>
            <p>We see how Africa had the least contributions to Wikipedia edits. We have to discuss how people in Africa interact with Wikipedia, whether they are concerned with correcting a wrong entry. Although Wikipedia is one of the biggest open encyclopaedias, other information storing systems may be used because people are more familiar with them. An example of this is found in how many African cultures were oral cultures. Information was transferred orally. Using music, African oral cultures would use songs to store important traditions and messages. These songs would be taught for generations and this is how this information was transported and transferred. This is just to highlight that ways of living affect how with platforms like Wikipedia engaged. I myself prefer listening to a biography on YouTube than reading it on Wikipedia. If I was to read the biography and find a wrong entry, I most probably would not edit it. Therefore, it is also important to highlight how studies like these cannot be generalized because people engage with information differently.</p>
            <p>Power relations are not only focused to information making. Historical power relations also shape who first gets access to skills and technology required to access the internet. Moreover, historical power relations also tell us who gets to make the rules of engagement of information transferring. I want to believe that if oral traditions were used more and technologies of information communication were more towards oral traditions, Africa would be at a better position than now.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I agree with Graham et al, the paper raises more questions than it does answers. I think this is a study that one can never get to a conclusion that covers everything and everyone.</p>
